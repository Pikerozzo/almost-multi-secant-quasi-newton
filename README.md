# Almost Multisecant Quasi-Newton Method

This project involved studying a scientific paper and reproducing its results through experiments on instances of linear regression and regularized logistic regression problems. 
The considered article ([Lee et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XW56zLleWK)) proposes an alternative approach for solving unconstrained optimization problems using Multisecant Quasi-Newton methods.

The project was developed as part of the _Optimization Techniques for Machine Learning_ course at the University of Florence.
